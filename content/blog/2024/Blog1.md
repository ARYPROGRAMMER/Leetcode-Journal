# A Day in 2023

Today was a fantastic day! I learned how to create dynamic blog routes in Next.js and organized my Markdown files neatly.

Here are some highlights:
- Learned about `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`
- Explored the power of `gray-matter`
- Organized blog posts by year

Stay tuned for more updates!
