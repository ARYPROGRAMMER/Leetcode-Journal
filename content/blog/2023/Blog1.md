Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. Here are some key features:

### Key Features
- **File-based Routing**: Automatically creates routes based on the file structure.
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints with ease.
- **Static Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time for better performance.
- **Server-side Rendering**: Fetch data and render pages on each request.

### Getting Started
To create a new Next.js project, run:
```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
```

Navigate to the project directory and start the development server:
```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

### Creating Pages
Create a new file in the `pages` directory to add a new route. For example, `pages/about.js`:
```jsx
export default function About() {
    return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```

### Deploying
Next.js can be deployed on various platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and more. For Vercel, simply run:
```bash
vercel
```

Next.js makes it easy to build fast and scalable web applications. Happy coding!
